## Steps to get Comboser on your Windows PC
Follow these steps _carefully_.
1.Download the latest Comboser ZIP from the [Releases](https://github.com/im-coder-lg/comboser/releases) page.
2.Extract it and go inside the Comboser directory.
3.You will have a directory like this:

![dirstructure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/im-coder-lg/comboser/main/dirstructure.png)

Sorry for that light mode if it hurt your eyes.

4.Right-click the `Install the cursors on Windows.inf` file and hit `Install`. The code is there for you to study, so you can check that for malware. If you find it, open a blank issue and inform us here.

5.Now, hit the <kbd>Windows</kbd> key and type `Mouse`. Now, it depends on your OS. If you run Windows 10, you must hit `Change the mouse pointer or display`. If you use Windows 8.1 or lower, you must hit the `Mouse` section. From now, everything is the same.

6.After opening the Mouse settings, go to the `Pointers` section and hit that drop-down section that contains `Windows Aero` in it.

7.Switch from `Windows Aero` to `Comboser`. You will get some error saying that the cursor is already being used, but you ignore it and hit `Apply`.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Comboser on your PC. If you have ideas on new icons for Comboser, post them here, I will try checking on them.
